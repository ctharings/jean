# JEAN

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Getting Started

There are two main parts to this application. The first is the REST API, for which we are using `express.js`. The second part is the Angular application server which we will start using `ng serve`.  

To get started run the commands below.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ctharings/jean.git
$ cd jean
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200/#/items) in your browser.

> Note: the above terminal commands are for Mac. Remember to substitute the appropriate commands for your OS.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
